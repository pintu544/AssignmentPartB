# Book Scraper and Database Storer

## Overview

This project is a web scraper that collects book data from [http://books.toscrape.com](http://books.toscrape.com) and stores it in an SQLite database. It scrapes book attributes like name, price, availability, and ratings from all 50 pages of the website.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
- npm (Node Package Manager): Included with Node.js installation

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone [<repository-url>](https://github.com/pintu544/AssignmentPartB)
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

3. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Create the SQLite database by running the database setup script:

   ```bash
   node /db/db.js
   ```

## Usage

To scrape book data and store it in the database, run the main script:

```bash
node index.js
```

The script will initiate the scraping process for all 50 pages of books from [http://books.toscrape.com](http://books.toscrape.com). The scraped data will be stored in the `books.db` SQLite database.

## Database Structure

The SQLite database (`books.db`) contains two tables:

1. `books`: Stores book data including title, price, availability, and rating.
2. `sqlite_sequence`: Automatically generated by SQLite to keep track of table row counts.
